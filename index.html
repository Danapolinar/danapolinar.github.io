        <h2>Why I Am Taking DESINV 23</h2>
        <p>
            I am taking DESINV 23 to learn more about how technical skills can be used creatively and to get more connected with my artistic side.
            I believe that for me art has been very useful to question things and to introspective about what I am or others are doing and why, 
            and I think that my EECS degree is the perfect thing to question and be introspective about.
